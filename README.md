# SPACE TEA - A VIM PLUGIN

*Space Tea* is named after the mapping I was repeatedly customising for running
unit tests - `<space>t`. This plugin makes it easy to:

- associate one or more test commands with a buffer and/or project
- run the tests asynchronously manually or via autocmd
- view the output in a separate terminal window as it runs
- access the test output in a new split/tab when finished
- remember which tests are associated with which buffers and projects
